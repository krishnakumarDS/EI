##  Exercise 1 – Design Patterns (TypeScript)

As part of Exercise-1, six different design patterns were implemented in *TypeScript* to demonstrate their real-world applications.

### Implemented Patterns

1. *Observer Pattern* – Notifies dependent objects when the state changes.
2. *Strategy Pattern* – Dynamically selects and applies an algorithm at runtime.
3. *Singleton Pattern* – Ensures only a single instance of a class exists.
4. *Abstract Factory Pattern* – Creates related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
5. *Adapter Pattern* – Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
6. *Decorator Pattern* – Adds new functionality to objects without changing their structure.

###  How to Run

1. Make sure *Node.js* is installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the *Exercise-1* folder.
3. Install dependencies (if required):

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

>  This command will compile and execute all TypeScript files automatically.

##  Exercise 2 – Virtual Classroom Manager (TypeScript)

### Project: *Virtual Classroom Manager*

The *Virtual Classroom Manager* is a *TypeScript-based terminal application* that models the backend for an EdTech platform. It provides a command-line interface for:

* Creating and managing virtual classrooms
* Enrolling students in classrooms
* Scheduling assignments for classes
* Submitting assignments by students
* Demonstrating *SOLID principles* and design patterns
* Implementing *repository pattern*, *service layer*, and error handling

###  How to Run (TypeScript)

1. Navigate to the *Exercise-2* folder.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```
